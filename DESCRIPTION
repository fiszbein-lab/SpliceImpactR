Description: Works by taking in processed data from the HIT Index and/or rMATS
    and identifying how differentially used alternative RNA processing events 
    lead to changes in protein function through various means. Primarily this 
    is done through protein similarity, functional protein domain analysis, and 
    domain-domain interaction changes. Notably, we both identify alterantive 
    RNA processing event 'swaps' across condition and are able to perform 
    holistic analyses regarding the impact of different RNA processing events.
