# Data within /extData/rawData was generated through manually generating a
# limited number of alternative RNA processing events across AFE ALE exon A3SS
# A5SS MXE RI SE that
# span events which will be significantly different across condition and events
# which will not be significantly different across conditions. Along with this,
# we generated .exon files to go with the AFE data.
#
# Having both significant events ensures the rest of the
# function of the package will be able to be minimally used.
#
# We also have limited datasets for annotations, protein features, ppidm setup
# for tests, examples, and vignettes for efficient runtime
