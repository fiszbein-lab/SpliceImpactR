\title{Bin elements under a cumulative cap (internal)}
\usage{
bin_under_cap(df, name_col, value_col, cap = 3100)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{data.frame} containing at least two columns: one
with element names and one with numeric values.}

\item{name_col}{Character string giving the column name for element
identifiers.}

\item{value_col}{Character string giving the column name for numeric
values used in cumulative binning.}

\item{cap}{Numeric scalar giving the maximum cumulative value allowed
per bin (default \code{3100}).}
}
\value{
A list where each element is a character vector of names that
  belong to one bin.  The bins are created sequentially in the order
  of the input rows.
}
\description{
Internal helper that groups elements sequentially into bins such that
the cumulative value in each bin does not exceed a specified cap.
Often used to split items for batch processing or job chunking based
on approximate size or cost.
}
\details{
The function walks through rows in order, adding elements to the
current bin until the running total exceeds \code{cap}, then starts a
new bin. The algorithm is greedy: it does not reorder or rebalance
after bin formation.
