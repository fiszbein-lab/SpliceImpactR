\title{Identify potential hybrid exons (internal)}
\usage{
identify_hybrid_exons_split(gtf_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtf_df}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{data.table} containing GTF
annotations with \code{gene_id}, \code{transcript_id},
\code{exon_id}, \code{chr}, \code{start}, \code{end}, and
\code{absolute_exon_class}.}
}
\value{
A list of two \code{data.table}s:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{first_hybrids} overlaps between first and internal exons
    \item \code{last_hybrids} overlaps between last and internal exons
  }
  Each includes transcript IDs, exon IDs, and mapped transcript
  \code{row_uid}s.
}
\description{
Internal helper to find exons that overlap between internal and
terminal (first/last) exons of different transcripts within the same
gene. Used to detect possible hybrid exon configurations.
}
\details{
Uses \pkg{data.table::foverlaps()} to identify exons that share
genomic coordinates but belong to different transcripts within the
same gene.
