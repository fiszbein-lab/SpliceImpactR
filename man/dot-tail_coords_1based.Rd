\title{Compute 1-based coordinates for the tail segment
when one interval fully overlaps another but differs
at exactly one boundary (start or end).}
\usage{
.tail_coords_1based(longS, longE, shortS, shortE)
}
\arguments{
\item{longS}{Integer vector of start coordinates for the longer interval.}

\item{longE}{Integer vector of end coordinates for the longer interval.}

\item{shortS}{Integer vector of start coordinates for the shorter interval.}

\item{shortE}{Integer vector of end coordinates for the shorter interval.}
}
\value{
A list with integer vectors:
  \item{start}{1-based start positions of the tail region.}
  \item{end}{1-based end positions of the tail region.}
}
\description{
Compute 1-based coordinates for the tail segment
when one interval fully overlaps another but differs
at exactly one boundary (start or end).
}
\details{
For intervals sharing either their start or end but not both,
returns the coordinates of the extra tail portion on the longer interval.
Invalid or negative-length intervals are returned as `NA`.
