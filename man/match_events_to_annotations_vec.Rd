\title{Match alternative splicing events to annotated exons and transcripts}
\usage{
match_events_to_annotations_vec(events, annotations, minOverlap = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{events}{A `data.frame` or `data.table` containing splicing events with
columns `chr`, `strand`, `gene_id`, and coordinate fields `inc` and `exc`
(semicolon-delimited `"start-end"` strings).}

\item{annotations}{A gene annotation table (e.g. from
[rtracklayer::import()] on a GTF file) with exon and transcript rows, passed
to [build_from_annotations()].}

\item{minOverlap}{Minimum fractional overlap (0-1) required between an
inclusion segment and an annotated exon to count as a hit. Default `0.05`.}
}
\value{
A `data.table` containing one row per input event with the following
  appended columns:
  \describe{
    \item{`transcript_id`}{The best matching transcript ID.}
    \item{`exons`}{Semicolon delimited list of exon IDs covered by the event.}
    \item{`inc_exons_by_idx`}{Semicolon delimited exon IDs per inclusion
      index (maintaining order).}
    \item{`inc_rows_by_idx`}{Semicolon delimited exon row indices matching
      inclusion order.}
  }
}
\description{
Performs vectorized overlap mapping between event coordinates (e.g. inclusion
or exclusion intervals) and exons from an annotation resource. Returns the
best-matching transcript and exon set per event based on coverage, exon
classification, and protein-coding preference.
}
\details{
The function uses [GenomicRanges::findOverlaps()] to match event inclusion
intervals to exons. Candidate transcripts are filtered to ensure sufficient
coverage and absence of overlaps with exclusion coordinates.

The algorithm prioritizes exon classification (`first`, `internal`, `last`)
consistent with the event type (AFE, ALE, SE, etc.), followed by reciprocal
overlap fractions, intersection width, and protein-coding status.
